#### My website hosting my data science portfolio
https://acodea23.github.io/data_science_portfolio/. Here's a [blogpost](https://acodea23.github.io/data_science_portfolio/projects/blog_post.html) I'm making about model sensitivity

#### I am a student at Brigham Young University studying statistics
I have taken classes in data science ecosystems, linear models, statistical theory, linear algebra, and coding (python and R)

#### I do research in the stats dept.
We are working on modeling multivariate censored data (data with multiple variables where some values aren't always included

#### I also did research in the math dept.
We submitted a paper about using real-variable techniques on complex harmonic polynomials

#### I want to learn more about machine learning
